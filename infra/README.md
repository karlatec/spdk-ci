# SPDK's Backend Intrafstructure

This directory contains scripts and configuration files which are part of SPDK's backend cloud infrastructure,
used for hosting Gerrit Code Review instance and for interacting with Github Actions, which is currently the
continous integration system for SPDK.

**Note:**
This is **not** a complete or authoritative representation of the current backend environment state, and cannot
be used to fully replicate (or set up from scratch) current infrastructure. There is no automated testing in place,
and no automated deployments done. The intention for contents of this directory is to have them backed up in Git
repository and to use as reference only.

Currently there are no plans for a full and public, "end to end" documentation and automation of SPDK's cloud
infrastructure.
